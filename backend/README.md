# VStream Backend

## Overview
This is the backend of the VStream platform, a YouTube-like application. It handles all the server-side logic, including API routes, database interactions, user authentication, and more.

## Folder Structure

## How It Works

- **Controllers**: These handle the core logic of the application. For instance, when a user requests to upload a video, `videoController.js` processes the request, validates the data, interacts with the database, and returns the appropriate response.
  
- **Models**: These define the structure of the data in MongoDB. For example, the `User.js` model outlines what a user document looks like, including fields like `name`, `email`, `password`, etc.

- **Routes**: These map HTTP requests to controller functions. When a request is made to `/api/videos`, `videoRoutes.js` routes it to the appropriate function in `videoController.js`.

- **Middlewares**: Middleware functions run before the main controller logic. For example, `authMiddleware.js` checks if a user is authenticated before allowing access to certain routes.

- **Utils**: These are helper functions that make it easier to perform common tasks, such as connecting to the database (`db.js`) or uploading files (`cloudinary.js`).

- **Config**: This folder contains configuration files for the application, including database setup (`dbConfig.js`) and third-party services like Cloudinary (`cloudinaryConfig.js`).

## Future Scope

- **Notifications System**: Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets or a service like Pusher to alert users about new comments, likes, and subscribers.
  
- **Advanced Analytics**: Build a detailed analytics dashboard to track video views, user engagement, and more.
  
- **Recommendation Engine**: Integrate a machine learning model to provide personalized video recommendations based on user behavior.
  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Refactor the backend to use microservices for scalability and better fault isolation.

- **Payment Integration**: Add support for premium content and subscriptions with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
