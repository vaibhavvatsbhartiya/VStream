# VStream Frontend

## Overview
This is the frontend of the VStream platform, a YouTube-like application built using Vite with React. It handles the user interface, video playback, navigation, and interaction with the backend API.

## Folder Structure

## How It Works

- **Components**: Each folder under `components/` contains a specific feature of the UI. For instance, `VideoPlayer.jsx` is responsible for rendering and controlling video playback.

- **Pages**: These are top-level components representing full pages, like the home page (`HomePage.jsx`) or the video detail page (`VideoPage.jsx`). Each page component typically renders multiple child components.

- **Context**: React Context is used for global state management. For example, `AuthContext.jsx` manages the authentication state (logged-in user) and makes it available to components throughout the app.

- **Hooks**: Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic that can be shared across components. For example, `useAuth.js` provides methods for login, logout, and checking authentication status.

- **Styles**: The `styles/` folder contains global styles (`global.css`) and theme-related variables (`variables.css`). This ensures consistent design across the application.

## Future Scope

- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
  
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Enhance the frontend to work offline and provide a more app-like experience with PWA features.
  
- **Video Editing Tools**: Add frontend tools for trimming, cropping, and adding filters to videos before upload.
  
- **Live Streaming**: Integrate live streaming capabilities with real-time chat features.
  
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure that the platform is fully accessible, with features like screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and color

 contrast adjustments.

- **Enhanced SEO**: Add server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for better SEO performance.
